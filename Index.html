            <p>My name is Louis Daniel G. Moran, a first year taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My birth month is February and I'm not actually from Negros, I'm from Rizal.<br>
			I'm a gamer i used to play for 6 hours a day of competitive online games like CS:G0, League of legends, Valorant, and Apex Legends. <br> I can't really remember what's my last rank in CS:GO but my peak rank in LOL is Grandmaster and peak diamond in Valorant while in Apex is i reached Predator.<br>
			I'm also a bookworm i mostly read books and novels right now. My top 3 novels are Shadow Slave, Lord of the Mysteries and Mushoku Tensei,<br> I'm currently reading Omniscient Viewpoint. When it comes to books i don't really have a top 3 but i did enjoy reading The Hunger games series up till mocking jay.<br> Listening to music helps me relax and think my fave artist are Zack Tabudlo, Cup of Joe, NIKI and Adele.
